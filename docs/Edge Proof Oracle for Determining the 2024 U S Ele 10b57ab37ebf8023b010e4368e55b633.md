## Introduction

**Edge Proofs Oracles** ensure data provenance, integrity, and authenticity, enabling blockchain applications to trust the external data they rely on, and subsequently use this data to determine the outcome of real world events. 

This capability is crucial for **Prediction Market Oracles**, a specialized subset of proof oracles designed to bring off-chain data on chain in a secure and trusted manner, ensuring accurate verification of real-world outcomes like elections.

The Prediction Market Oracle mechanism works as follows:

1. **Declare Reputable Sources**: Trusted sources like the Associated Press, NBC, or Fox are designated in advance. These serve as the inputs for resolving prediction market events, such as determining the winner of a U.S. election.
2. **Prove Data Provenance, Integrity, and Authenticity**: The oracle ensures that the data remains in its original form, untampered, and precisely as published by the declared sources, preserving the integrity of the input.
3. **Determine Event Outcome**: Each Node‚Äôs Orchestrator frontier LLM model processes the text and is prompted with the following task: ‚Äú**Task**: Based solely on the **provided documents** from the Associated Press (AP), Fox News, and NBC, extract whether a winner has been declared by each source for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.‚Äù Requirements include
    1. **Objectivity**: Do not include personal opinions, interpretations, or predictions.
    2. **Clarity**: Ensure your response is clear and unambiguous.
    3. **Formatting**: Strictly adhere to the JSON response format provided.
    
    ```json
    {
      "sources": {
        "AP": "Jane Doe",
        "FoxNews": "Not Declared",
        "NBC": "Jane Doe"
      }
    }
    ```
    
4. **Achieve Consensus**: To ensure the reliability of the outcome, the oracle network achieves consensus among multiple nodes. This step guarantees that no single entity can unilaterally determine the event's outcome, ensuring transparency and decentralization.

Crucially, Prediction Market Oracles do not act as arbiters of truth but ensure that trusted data sources and transparent methods are used to resolve event outcomes. This approach delivers a scalable, decentralized solution while minimizing human bias and intervention.

**Objective**: Filter and select neutral, objective, and directly relevant documents to determine the specific event outcome.

![image.png](Edge%20Proof%20Oracle%20for%20Determining%20the%202024%20U%20S%20Ele%2010b57ab37ebf8023b010e4368e55b633/image%204.png)

### Process

- **Prompt Engineering and Multi-Agent Framework**:
    - Employ prompt engineering to guide LLMs in evaluating documents based on specific criteria.
    - Implement a multi-agent orchestration framework where multiple agents collaborate to assess and filter documents.
    - Each node in the consensus algorithm uses this multi-step, multi-agent framework, with each node employing a different frontier model as the orchestrator.
- **Filtering Criteria**:
    1. **Neutral Sentiment**:
        - Analyze documents to ensure they exhibit neutral sentiment.
        - Exclude documents with biased or subjective language.
    2. **Objectivity Assessment**:
        - Prioritize factual reporting over opinion pieces or editorials.
        - Remove documents that lack objectivity.
    3. **Hard-News Category**:
        - Focus on hard-news articles that report events without interpretation.
        - Filter out soft news or feature stories that do not contribute to determining the outcome.
    4. **Relevance Check**:
        - Ensure the documents are directly related to the specific event outcome.
        - Discard any content that is not pertinent to determining who won the election.
- **Information Extraction**:
    - Remove non-relevant information to concentrate on the core task.
    - Extract key information that directly pertains to the event outcome.
    - Format the extracted content into a standardized structure (e.g., JSON).

### Multi-Agent Framework Steps

2. **Sentiment Analysis Agent**:
    - Evaluate each document for sentiment neutrality.
    - Filter out documents exhibiting bias or strong subjective language.
3. **Objectivity Assessment Agent**:
    - Assess the objectivity of the remaining documents.
    - Remove any documents that are opinionated or not fact-based.
4. **Relevance Agent**:
    - Check the relevance of documents to the specific event outcome.
    - Exclude documents that do not provide direct information about the election results.
5. **Content Extraction Agent**:
    - Extract essential information related to the event outcome.
    - Eliminate any extraneous data or commentary.
6. **Final Document Compilation**:
    - Compile the filtered and processed documents.
    - Prepare the data for input into the LLM Consensus Algorithm.

### Diversity Through Different Frontier Models

- **Node Diversity**:
    - Each node in the consensus algorithm uses a different frontier model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama) as the orchestrator in the multi-agent framework.
    - This approach enhances diversity in data processing and reduces the risk of systemic biases.
- **Multi-Step Execution**:
    - Nodes execute the multi-agent framework in steps, ensuring thorough filtering and evaluation at each stage.
    - Different models may interpret data slightly differently, but the consensus mechanism ensures alignment on the final outcome.

## 3. LLM Consensus Algorithm

**Objective**: Achieve a unanimous decision on the election outcome using multiple leading LLMs.

### Process

- **Model Selection**:
    - Utilize top-tier models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama.
- **Data Consensus**:
    - Ensure all models agree on the input data by cross-validating the extracted information from the LLM Document Selector.
- **Event Extraction**:
    - Each model independently runs an event extraction algorithm to interpret the results.
- **Result Formatting**:
    - Convert unstructured data into a standardized JSON format.
- **Edge Consensus Algorithm**:
    - Aggregate outputs from all models.
    - **Consensus Rule**: Require 100% agreement among the models for final event resolution.
